journal.document.adventurers_guide.intro.body=Greetings Adventurer, you are reading the Tome of Gensokyo Mastery! This book is full of tips and tricks to help budding adventurers!\n\nFirst, try to find all spellcards of upgrade as you can. Upgrading an equipment enhances your item and reduce required strength by 1. You can also use nito dismantle hammer, and it is highly recommended.\n\nSome items are an excellent benchmark of how well you're exploring and looting. You will be able to find 2 strength cards and 3 upgrade cards, in each five floor dungeon region, and many important resources.
journal.document.adventurers_guide.examining.title=Examining
journal.document.adventurers_guide.examining.body=Rushing into enemies is almost never the best way to deal with them. It's important to take your time and study your opponents and surroundings so that you can learn how best to defeat them!\n\nExamining things also takes no time, so it's best to get in the habit of doing it to everything new you encounter.\n\nGensokyo is very dangerous! Enemies are very strong and have dangerous ability, so be cafeful!\n\nYou can examine something by using the magnifying glass button, and selecting the thing you want to examine. You can also examine buffs or debuffs by selecting their icons.
journal.document.adventurers_guide.surprise_attacks.title=Surprise Attacks
journal.document.adventurers_guide.surprise_attacks.body=You're guaranteed to hit an enemy as a melee weapon if you surprise them by attacking from outside of their view, or right as you enter their view. Even the most enemies can't dodge a surprise attack, which makes them very useful against enemies and reduce RNG to prevent losing health.\n\nOne of the most common parts of the environment you can use to surprise enemies is a door, if an enemy chases you through one you can turn around as they enter and catch them by surprise!\n\nHowever, in some situation, you cannot surprise attack. For example, if you have survival fittest ability card, you cannot surprise attack.
journal.document.adventurers_guide.identifying.title=Identifying Items
journal.document.adventurers_guide.identifying.body=You won't know all of the properties of some items when you first find them.\n\nThe color of each potion and symbol of each spellcard is different in each dungeon. Unidentified equipment can be upgraded or enchanted if you're lucky, or it might be cursed!\n\nSpellcards of identify, upgrade, or remove curse are very useful if you want to reduce the risk of using unidentified items.\n\n(You can find a list of all the items you've identified in the items tab of your journal)
journal.document.adventurers_guide.food.title=Dealing with Hunger
journal.document.adventurers_guide.food.body=Rationing food effectively is one of the best things you can do to improve your odds of survival. It's best to think of health and hunger as resources that need to be managed, rather than being kept full at all times.\n\nStarving hurts, and being full slowly heals you. If you have full health though, the health regeneration you get from being full will be wasted.\n\nIf you pace out when you eat based on how your health is doing, your food should last much longer.
journal.document.adventurers_guide.ability_cards.title=Ability Cards
journal.document.adventurers_guide.ability_cards.body=For some floor shops, these shop sells ability cards than normal items. when you pick an ability card, others in current shop disappears.\n\nAbility cards can dramatically change the game to more easier, so think what ability card fits perfect for your play style!
journal.document.adventurers_guide.searching.title=Searching
journal.document.adventurers_guide.searching.body=Dungeons are full of secret doorways and traps which appear invisible at first glance. Searching takes time, but is very useful if you suspect something is hidden.\n\nSearch near walls if you suspect a door is hidden, or around floors if you suspect a trap is hidden.\n\n(You can search all the tiles around you by using the magnifying glass button twice. Anything that's hidden in these tiles will be revealed.)
journal.document.adventurers_guide.strength.title=Strength
journal.document.adventurers_guide.strength.body=There won't be any time to train with weapons and armor you find in the dungeon, so you'll need brute strength to use them effectively.\n\nPotions of Strength directly enhance your physical might and are the most effective way to meet the requirements of heavier, higher tier gear.\n\nIt's important to work towards heavier, high tier items, but don't completely ignore equipment you can use sooner as well. Once you're deep enough in the dungeon you'll need high tier gear to survive, but you have to survive long enough to equip it first!
journal.document.adventurers_guide.upgrades.title=Upgrades
journal.document.adventurers_guide.upgrades.body=The higher you ascend in the dungeon, the more important it is that you're using magically enhanced gear.\n\nHigher tier weapons and armor gain more power from upgrades, but you'll also need the strength to use them properly. Hakkeros, rings, and artifacts don't need strength, but have limited usages or don't help as directly in combat.\n\nMaking good choices about what you upgrade is one of the most important ways to set yourself up for success later in the dungeon. The most successful adventurers will end their dungeon runs with highly upgraded high tier gear, with using nito dismantle hammer support!
journal.document.adventurers_guide.item_use.title=Using items
journal.document.adventurers_guide.item_use.body=Got stuck? Check all items you have just like hakkeros, tailsmans, danmakus, and spellcards, etc... and think what item fits for killing that dangerous situation.\n\nUnless you have any life, once you die, the game is over. Using items in various situations well proofs how you are a good gensokyo adventurer.\n\nFor example, try using debilitation tailsman, or a spellcard. These are very powerful and make an enemy very easy to kill. Unfortunately, gensokyo dungeoneering is hard and most adventurers will eventually meet their demise. While luck can definitely play a role, the best adventurers are the ones who use every little trick to improve their odds of success.
journal.document.adventurers_guide.levelling.title=Gaining Experience
journal.document.adventurers_guide.levelling.body=Your experience level boosts your accuracy, evasion, health. All of these can make a big difference in combat. It's best to have at least one level for each floor of the dungeon.\n\nIt can be tempting to rush through a dungeon, avoiding exploration and combat, but doing so will deprive you of both supplies and experience.\n\n(You can see information about your hero, including exp, on the status pane at the corner of the game interface. Select your hero portrait to get even more info.)
journal.document.adventurers_guide.positioning.title=Positioning
journal.document.adventurers_guide.positioning.body=Effectively fighting enemies depends on good strategy as well as strong equipment. Bad situations like getting surrounded are often preventable with good positioning.\n\nFor instance, most dungeons have thin corridors, which are excellent at forcing enemies to fight you one at a time. These corridors often have doorways too, which can be used for surprise attacks!\n\nThere are lots of little ways to use environmental features like grass, water, or traps to your advantage as well.
journal.document.adventurers_guide.magic.title=Magical Attacks
journal.document.adventurers_guide.magic.body=Magical attacks cut right through armor and are extremely difficult to dodge. This means that your hakkeros will be very reliable, but also makes magical enemies extremely dangerous!\n\nMagical attacks always have a drawback though. In the case of hakkeros it's their limited charges, but magic that enemies use will always have some form of weakness as well.\n\nWhen facing enemies that use magic it is extremely important to figure out how to evade their magic, rather than just eating the damage from it.

journal.document.alchemy_guide.catalysts.title=Catalysts
journal.document.alchemy_guide.catalysts.body=Catalysts are made by combining a spellcard or potion with a single seed or runestone.
